TODO:
- "Lite" means lighter UI, lighter scale
- Dynamic appearance vs Static appearance
- Why the algorithms are not the same (i.e. graphology)

- List other missing features (preview, SVG export, scalability...)
- List other additional features ("cloud-like" save on GitHub, data model, node images, experimental features...)
