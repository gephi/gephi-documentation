This User Manual will cover some technicalities about Gephi Lite.

For ressource limitation reasons, we did not cover (yet) the core features which are similar to Gephi. We focused so far on the _lite-specific_ features.

We would be glad to cover all feature in this documentation. If you'd like to help please read the [contribute documentation](../contribute.md).
