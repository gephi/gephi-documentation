---

We welcome contributors to enhance this documentation.

Contributing to the documentation requires to write markdown documents and posting them on [this github repository](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-documentation).

To fix/edit existing page you can use the `edit this page` button which appears on all pages footers.

To propose new pages, feel free to open a Github Pull Request.

If you're interested but need help please contact us on the [Gephi community matrix chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/!XKyOZNGdXvoRWJbPCL:matrix.org). Actually before any consistent contribution (such as creating new pages), it would be better to get in touch with the Gephi Lite beforehand.

Thank you in advance for your help!
