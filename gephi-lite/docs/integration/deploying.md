You can easily deploy **Gephi Lite** in your environment.  
This guide explains several ways to do it.

## Using Docker

We provide an official Docker image of Gephi Lite: [Docker Hub - ouestware/gephi-lite](https://hub.docker.com/r/ouestware/gephi-lite)

The image contains a built version of Gephi Lite, served by [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) on port `80`. 

To use it, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
docker pull ouestware/gephi-lite:latest
docker run --name gephi-lite -d -p 80:80 ouestware/gephi-lite:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.


## Build from Source

Gephi Lite is a [React](https://react.dev/) application. To build it, you need [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite.git 
cd gephi-lite
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```sh
export BASE_URL=/ && npm run build
```

:::info
By default, the build process creates a website that must be served under the `/gephi-lite` path (e.g. [http://localhost/gephi-lite/](http://localhost/gephi-lite/)).  

In the example above, we set the environment variable `BASE_URL` to `/` so the application can be served at the root of the domain.  
You can adjust it to any path you prefer.

4. The static files of the Gephi Lite application are built in the folder:

```
./packages/gephi-lite/build/
```

You can copy these files to any location, for example `/var/www/html/gephi-lite`.

5. Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to serve this folder.  
Hereâ€™s an **Nginx example**:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  server_name _;

  # Replace this location with the one where you placed the Gephi Lite files
  root /var/www/html/gephi-lite; 

  # Required for React applications
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  # For GitHub authentication to work
  # We need to create a GitHub proxy to `https://github.com/login` that accepts CORS
  location /_github/login {
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, user-agent";

    if ($request_method = OPTIONS) {
      return 204;
    }

    proxy_pass https://github.com/login;
  }
}
```
