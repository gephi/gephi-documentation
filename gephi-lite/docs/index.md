This documentation has been written by the Gephi Lite developer team to help users gain better knowledge about Gephi Lite features.

For beginners we recommend starting by:

- the official [Gephi Lite 101 tutorial](https://gephi.org/101/lite)
- [Dr. Ver√≥nica Espinoza tutorial](https://medium.com/@vespinozag/learn-how-to-make-a-network-in-gephi-lite-and-add-images-to-the-nodes-i-give-you-the-gexf-file-76635f3aab53)

You can browse tow different sections:

- [User manual](./user-manual/): description of the main features
- [Integration](./integration/): more advanced section on integrating Gephi Lite in existing web application

We hope this documentation will help!  
_(despite its limitations)_

It is unfortunately not exhaustive.  
_We tried to focus on the more advanced and less obvious features._

It is only available in english.  
_We can not support internalization for now._
