Development versions of Gephi can be installed and tested without affecting your stable Gephi installation. This is useful for trying out new features, before they are released in a stable version. It's also a way to benefit from bugfixes that are not yet available in the stable release.

## Download Development Builds

Development builds are located [here](https://github.com/gephi/gephi?tab=readme-ov-file#latest-releases). Download and install the version that matches your operating system.

Note that development builds are not fully tested and may be unstable. They are provided for testing purposes only. Plugins also need to be installed manually (by downloading the NBM files from the plugin portal) as the automatic update center is not available in development builds.
