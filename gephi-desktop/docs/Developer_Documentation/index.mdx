Welcome, if you’re new to the codebase or want a fast, practical overview of Gephi’s architecture and how the project is organized, watch the short video and review the **[slides](https://gephi.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/introduction-to-gephi-codebase-and-development.pdf)**. The video walks through Gephi’s core concepts, common workflows and the high‑level architecture (modules, APIs/SPIs, and extension points),

Both resources are up‑to‑date and are an excellent first step.
