This section is designed to help developers write [Gephi Plugins](https://gephi.org/plugins/). 

Gephi can be extended in many ways and the major categories are Layout, Export, Import, Data Laboratory, Filter, Generator, Metric, Preview, Tool, and Appearance. 

A good way to start is to look at examples with the [bootcamp](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins-bootcamp). Another way is to look at existing plugins source code, which is publicly available on GitHub: [Gephi Plugins on GitHub](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins/tree/master-forge/modules).

Official documentation about plugin development can be found directly on Github: [Gephi Plugin Development](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins). We've also made a custom [Maven plugin](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-maven-plugin) to help get started and validate your plugin faster.
