A figure depicting the largest component of this network can be found here. M. E. J. Newman, Phys. Rev. E 74, 036104 (2006).
- [GEXF file](/datasets/cpan-authors.gexf.zip). **CPAN authors**: CPAN Explorer is a visualization project aiming at analyzing the relationships between the developers and the packages of the Perl language, known as the CPAN community. This snapshot was created by Linkfluence in July 2009. This file contains the network of developers, linked when they use the same Perl module. Original data can be found [here](http://cpan-explorer.org/).
- [GEXF file](/datasets/cpan-distributions.gexf.zip). **CPAN distributions**: CPAN Explorer is a visualization project aiming at analyzing the relationships between the developers and the packages of the Perl language, known as the CPAN community.

## Biological networks

- [GEXF](/datasets/diseasome.gexf.zip). **Diseasome**: A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder–gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules.
