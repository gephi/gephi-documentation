the leading desktop software to visualize networks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers {#_the_leading_desktop_software_to_visualize_networks_on_linux_windows_and_apple_computers}
========================================================================================

-   more than 2 million downloads,

-   used by analysts, academics, journalists,

-   stable on Windows, Mac and Linux,

-   in continuous development

open source & free (including for commercial purposes) {#_open_source_amp_free_including_for_commercial_purposes}
======================================================

Gephi adopts a licencing model which makes it free to use, sell, or
include the source code of Gephi in larger applications.

Developers who modify the Gephi code base are required to make these
changes public, to benefit the community.

\"Photoshop^TM^ for graphs\" {#_photoshop_superscript_tm_superscript_for_graphs}
============================

-   for networks of all types (social, semantic, biological, etc.)

-   attributes and properties of the network are made visible: not just
    the [topology](http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/topologies.asp) of
    the network.

-   Gephi provides functions to explore the network: pan, filter, zoom,
    colorize, label, etc.

-   measures and metrics can be computed, and then rendered visually.

committed to quality and performance {#_committed_to_quality_and_performance}
====================================

-   Gephi won a [Duke Award in
    2010](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/dukeschoicewinners-171159.html).
    Duke awards \"recognize and honor extreme innovation in the world of
    Java technology\".

-   Gephi evolved importantly since 2006 to adopt new, best performing
    techs for the visualization of very large graphs on the desktop

-   The code base of Gephi is maintained with the best standards to
    insure a [a stable application, ease of maintainance and modularity
    / extensibility](https://gephi.wordpress.com/tag/code/).

modular and extensible {#_modular_and_extensible}
======================

-   Gephi is \"cut\" in a large number of modules, each providing a
    specific function. This makes it easier to maintain and evolve the
    software, by working on independent parts.

-   Since version 0.9 the [\"graph
    store\"](https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/gephi-boosts-its-performance-with-new-graphstore-core/)
    of Gephi has become a completely independent module: it can be
    reused by another software.

-   Anybody can create new modules for Gephi! [They are called
    \"plugins\"](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/). They integrate with
    Gephi seamlessly.

created, maintained and documented by volunteers, for the community. {#_created_maintained_and_documented_by_volunteers_for_the_community}
====================================================================

-   Gephi itself is open source and free

-   The [Gephi Consortium](https://consortium.gephi.org) was created to
    ensure Gephi will remain so

-   The [original contributors and their
    followers](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/graphs/contributors) are
    volunteers

-   The support to users through [forums](http://forum-gephi.org),
    [discussion groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gephi) and
    [documents](https://gephi.org/users/) is provided for free.
