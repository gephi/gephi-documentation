This section is designed to help developers write [Gephi Plugins](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/). 

Gephi can be extended in many ways but the major categories are Layout, Export, Import, Data Laboratory, Filter, Generator, Metric, Preview, Tool, Appearance and Clustering. A good way to start is to look at examples with the [bootcamp](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins-bootcamp).
